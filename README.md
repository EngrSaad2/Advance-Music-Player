AMP (SAAD) is a free, powerful and elegant music player for Android. AMP (SAAD) used to be a trial/paid app on the Play Store. Due to my lack of adequate free time and Google's new requirement for paid developers to publicly display their home address, I've decided that I can no longer provide the level of support and regular updates that paid users expect from a developer.

Rather than letting Music completely die off, I've open sourced the app and hosted it here to encourage other developers to potentially improve it, use it in their own personal projects, and re-release it to users. I will still occasionally update this app based on my free time, but it will probably be beta quality code.

If you are a developer who's interested in using my current codebase, I encourage you to fork this repository and/or directly contribute to it. If you decide to launch your own fork of this app on the Play Store, feel free to drop me a line so I can feature it on this GitHub page.....
